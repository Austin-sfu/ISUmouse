# mouse_exp3_dataset

This is the "mouse_exp3_dataset" dataset. 

Originally collected by the Kinesiology Department of Iowa State University


Data was collected through an online game programmed in Javascript, embedded in a Qualtrics survey and running in Windows 10 environment. In the game subjects were asked to perform a predefined mouse task which includes 10 consecutive movements in a pattern illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:trial-static2}. Subjects are instructed by the following rules:
(1)Use the mouse to move the cursor to the green target as quickly as possible.
(2)Left click once the cursor is inside the green target before the target disappears. 
(3)After clicking on the green target, the next target will appear.
(4)Stay inside the green target until you see the next target. Click ONLY when you are inside the green target.
(5)Always keep the mouse in constant contact with the surface. 
(6)Simply continue this in the same manner until the pattern stops.

Iris Data Set, this small dataset from 1936 is often used for testing out machine learning algorithms and visualizations (for example, Scatter Plot). 
Each row of the table represents an iris flower, including its species and dimensions of its botanical parts, sepal and petal, in centimeters.
